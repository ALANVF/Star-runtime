# Star-runtime
A basic runtime for the Star programming language

# Running
If you want to run this yourself, you should do the following:
- Make sure you are using C++17 or newer.
- Add the command-line flag `-fsized-deallocation` when running.
- Add the command-line flag `-Wno-undefined-var-template` when running.
- Include the .cpp files in the runtime folder when running (temporary).

I've currently only tested this with VS2019 and Clang 7, but it should work with the GCC too.
